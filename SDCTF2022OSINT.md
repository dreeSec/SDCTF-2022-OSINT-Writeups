Challenge Description:  
Sometimes I worry about my friend... he's way too into memes, he's always smiling, and he's always spouting nonsense about some "forbidden app." I don't know what he's talking about, but maybe you can help me figure it out! All I know is a username he used way back in the day. Good luck! Flag format is sdctf{flag}
